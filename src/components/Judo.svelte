            <span slot="header">1. Repetitive nature of Judo.</span>
            <p>Change is a common source of anxiety for many people with Autism (Neil, Olsson, & Pellicano, 2016). The structure and repetitive nature of Judo makes it a sport that young people with Autism can enjoy and thrive at (Garcia et al., 2020).</p>

            <span slot="header">2. Increases physical activity levels</span>
<p>Young people with ASD engage in less physical activity and spend more time engaged in sedentary behaviours than their neurotypical peers (Pan et al., 2016). Adapted judo programs provide a great opportunity for them to engage in regular physical activity. Furthermore, adapted judo programs have been found to increase their comfort/ability to engage in physical activity, thereby increasing their daily physical activity levels (Garcia et al., 2020).</p>

            <span slot="header">3. Improves cardiovascular fitness and decreases risk of cardiometabolic diseases later in life</span>
            <p>At least partially as a result of lower fitness levels, individuals with Autism have a higher incidence of cardio-metabolic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension later in life (Flygare Wallén, Ljunggren, Carlsson, Pettersson, & Wändell, 2018). Judo involves moderate-vigorous physical activity and has been found to increase the VO2 max of participants with Autism, which is protective against cardio-metabolic conditions (Pierantozzi et al., 2022).</p>

            <span slot="header">4. Improves balance and postural control</span>
            <p>Individuals with ASD are often less stable and show increased postural sway compared to their neurotypical peers (Bojanek, Wang, White, & Mosconi, 2020). Judo results in significant improvements in this area due to the balance and postural control requirements of the sport’s exercises (Kujach et al., 2022).</p>

        <AccordionItem>
            <span slot="header">5. Improves social interaction</span>
            <p>One of the primary characteristics of Autism is difficulty with social interactions (Autism Spectrum Australia, 2023). Practicing Judo techniques requires cooperation and teamwork with a partner and therefore facilitates building social skills in a safe environment. A study of 40 children with ASD found that they showed significant improvement in the ‘social interaction’ and ‘social communication’ subsets of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale following an 8-week Judo program (Rivera et al., 2020).</p>

            <span slot="header">6. Increase self-esteem</span>
            <!-- <p>Individuals with autism have lower personal self-esteem levels than their neurotypical peers (Cooper, Smith, & Russell, 2017).  Judo provides a space in which young people can learn new skills and advance grades through dedication and practice. Following an eight-week judo program for young people with ASD, 78% of the participants parents reported that their children had greater self-esteem and confidence levels (Rivera et al., 2020).</p> -->
            <p>Individuals with autism have lower personal self-esteem levels than their neurotypical peers (Cooper, Smith, & Russell, 2017).  Judo provides a space in which young people can learn new skills and advance grades through dedication and practice. Gradings involve a physical demonstration of skills rather than written, verbal or social skills. Following an eight-week judo program for young people with ASD, 78% of the participants parents reported that their children had greater self-esteem and confidence levels (Rivera et al., 2020).</p>

            <span slot="header">7. Boosts mental health</span>
            <p>Individuals with Autism disproportionally suffer from mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression (Lever & Geurts, 2016). Engaging in regular physical activity is well documented to improve mental health, and this effect has been found to hold true for young adults with Autism (Accardo, Pontes, & Pontes, 2023). </p>

            <span slot="header">8. Increases comfort with physical contact</span>
            <!-- <p>Physical touch is a source of discomfort for many people with Autism (Schaffler, Middleton, & Abdus-Saboor, 2019). Judo provides an environment in which children with Autism can get more comfortable with physical contact through physical contact mediated through the grip of the judo uniform. (Morales et al., 2021). </p> -->
            <p>Physical touch is a source of discomfort for many people with Autism (Schaffler, Middleton, & Abdus-Saboor, 2019). Judo provides an environment in which children with Autism can get more comfortable with physical contact through contact mediated through the grip of the judo uniform (Morales et al., 2021). Unlike most other contact sports, Judo involves having others in your personal space without heavy contact or hitting.</p>

            <span slot="header">9. Improves emotional regulation</span>
            <p>Individuals with Autism often struggle to regulate their emotions, which often manifests as emotional outbursts and aggression (Mazefsky et al., 2013). Judo requires self-discipline and has been found to significantly improve emotional regulation abilities in young people with Autism (Morales et al., 2021).</p>

            <span slot="header">10. Provide an opportunity to excel and gain unique experiences</span>
            <p>Judo provides an opportunity to excel by progressing through the grade system and competing in tournaments. There are international competition opportunities for people with Autism such as the Virtus Games. This provides an opportunity for young people with Autism to excel on the world stage and gain incredible experiences. Numerous individuals with Autism have also excelled in mainstream competitions in Australia.</p>
