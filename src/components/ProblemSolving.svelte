    <Heading tag="h3" class="my-3">Phase 1: Website outline and contacting stakeholders. (August-October)</Heading>
    <P class="my-2">As per my Gantt Chart, I began my project by creating an outline of my website. This helped me to home in on the areas that I need to research. I decided to create five pages; ‘what is autism?’, ‘why judo?’, ‘coaching guidelines’, ‘class ideas’ and ‘resources.’</P>
    <P class="my-2">I then contacted potential stakeholders to see if they would be willing to be project stakeholders by completing a feedback form on the draft product. Unfortunately, one of the stakeholders did not have the capacity to do this. As it was important for me to have a researcher’s perspective, I conducted a search to find other experts in this field. This search led me to contact Jan Burns, a researcher for Wellington University and founder of Invictus Academy, who agreed to be a stakeholder.</P>

    <Heading tag="h3" class="my-3">Phase 2: Research and content creation. (October)</Heading>
    <P class="my-2">I created the ‘Why Judo’ page so that Judo coaches accessing my website without prior interest in coaching young people with ASD may become motivated to coach this population. Furthermore, it will help sell the value of my product if I disseminate it to special need organisations in the future. My literature search was narrowed to peer reviewed articles, to increase the trustworthiness of the information.</P>
    <P class="my-2">I created the ‘what is autism’ page as I think the ability of coaches to coach both mainstream and adaptive judo lessons will be improved if they have a good understanding of autism spectrum disorder.  In my personal experience, I have found that the more I understand about ASD, the better Judo coach I am to young people with ASD. My literature search for this section included both peer reviewed articles and websites from authoritative sources.</P>
    <P class="my-2">I created the ‘coaching guidelines’ page to give coaches information on best practice when coaching young people with ASD. My literature search for this page included only peer reviewed articles. I created the ‘class ideas’ page so that it is easy for a Judo coach with no prior experience in running adapted judo classes to create their first lesson plans. My literature search did not turn up many results, and so many of the class ideas are ones I have used effectively when running adapted judo classes. The ’resources’ page was created by adapting current resources used by Senshi Academy.</P>  
    <P class="my-2">The content was then proof-read by a variety of individuals to check for language errors. This was done at this stage to ensure professionalism of the website when it was sent to the stakeholders.</P>

    <Heading tag="h3" class="my-3">Phase 3: Website development (Early November)</Heading>
    <P class="my-2">Once the content was finalised, I began to create the website. I looked at other websites in the same field for inspiration and sketched a design for each page of the website before developing it.</P>

    <Heading tag="h3" class="my-3">Phase 4: Evaluation (Late November)</Heading>
    <P class="my-2">Once the draft product was complete, product evaluation began. I decided to evaluate my product both through a SWOT analysis and through feedback from my stakeholders in the form of a survey. A SWOT analysis is a great tool for evaluation; it allows the identification of strengths that should be built upon, opportunities that should be seized, weaknesses that should be addressed, and risks that should be minimised.  I created a survey on ‘survey monkey’ for my stakeholders to complete. This survey contained both questions specific to certain sections of the website and general questions about the website.</P>

    <Heading tag="h3" class="my-3">Phase 5: Final adjustments (Late November)</Heading>
    <P class="my-2">The final step in the product development was making adjustments to the website based on the results of the SWOT Analysis and the survey. </P>
